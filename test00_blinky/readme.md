# Test Project 0: Blinky

This project blinks the 4 LEDs at the attachment end of the Acorn in binary fashion. The oscillator used is the one feeding the memory bank, so no PCIe connection is required.

To recreate the project, use the TCL console in Vivado. Navigate to this directory and run the command `source ./proj_blinky.tcl`.
